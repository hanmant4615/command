pwd = see current directory 



mkdir = make a directory
if already directory present then it shows error files exits


cd = change directory


touch = create the empty file


cat = read the  content in the file 

to write content in file  1) echo command syntax: echo "data" > filename (when call second time it replace first content on the file)
2) vi editor syntax = vi filename

ls = list the item in directory 


The ls -l command displays directory contents in long format. The long format contains both permissions and ownership


df = shows he size ,info of directiory

cp =copy the content from file to file 
syntax = cp soruce_file destination_file

for directory 
cp -r  soruce_file destination_file


to remove the file 
command = rm
syntax = rm file_name

To removr=e the directory 

rmdir file_name (it works only when directory is empty beside they give warning directory is not empty)



To see the first 10 file or content 
command =ls |head

to see the process run in cpu 
command top

to see the working or use of the command 
for root user use command syntax  command --help
for user syntax man command



to see the permission on the file 
command ls - l head


to delete the coomand in command prompt then 
command = clear



Root directory is the most important directory in the Linux file system. 
It is the parent directory to all other directories present in the file system.
 It is denoted by /. You can navigate to the root directory from any other directory by using the following command.

cd /

/ Root directory(parent)
~ cd root (root directory in Root )


to see the root dirctory 
command cd /
then ls -l /
 
to see user in the system 
command ls -l usr/bin/users


Hardlink and softlink 

1. Create hard link to a file
To create a hard link to a file, you can use the ln command without any options like this:

 ln target_file link_name

2. Create soft link to a file
To create a symbolic link to a file, use the option -s with the target file name and the link name

syntax =  ln -s target_file link_name

3. Create soft link to a directory
Creating a soft link to a directory is the same as creating symbolic link to a file. You just need to replace the target file name/path with the directory name/path.

 syntax = ln -s target_directory link_name


The ln command has two options for this purpose:

-i: The interactive mode asks you if you want to overwrite the existing link.
-f: The force mode just updates the existing link without any confirmation.


Hard Links
These links point to the same file
Have the same inode number.
They can not span over multiple 
filesystems.
Can not be used on directories

softlink 

Also called as a symbolic link.
Can link files on different file 
systems.
Can be used on directories.

hardlink softlink 

to link the file 
command ln 
syntax = ln filename type_of_link



Users and Group

Creating the users

Command: useradd USERS_NAME

each user must have a password. 
To add passwords we use  passwd command 

syntax : passwd ******

to change the user "su" command is use 
i.e. su user_name

To find the user the "whoami" command is use


 create the groups 
command : groupadd
syntax: groupadd groupA

manage ownership and groups:

 To change the user/owner associated with file then use " chown  " command
syntax :  chown user_name
 To change the group associated with file then use  " chown :group_name file_name " format
To change the owner and group at the same time  then use "chown user_name:group_name file_name"


manage permissions

The change mode or chmod command sets permissions. The syntax is straight-forward:
chmod permissions resource-name

Access level	Octal value
Read	                      4
Write	                      2
Execute	                      1

Each identity (user, group, others) has a position:
Identity	Position
User	First or left-most
Group	Middle
Others	Last or right-most
 
SELinux  

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a security architecture for Linux systems that allows administrators to have more control over who can access the system. It was originally developed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) as a series of patches to the Linux kernel using Linux Security Modules (LSM).  

SELinux was released to the open source community in 2000, and was integrated into the upstream Linux kernel in 2003.
